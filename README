This describes development of the ThreeDUP Octoprint plugin to display temperatures in Octoprint.

This will be facilitated using this Octoprint plugin:

https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/plotlytempgraph/

To install the working version of our plugin cd into 3DUP-octoprint first create
a virtual python environment:

virtualenv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate.csh
pip install -e .[develop,plugins]


To install the current code, from 3DUP-octoprint:

../OctoPrint/venv3/bin/octoprint dev plugin:install

To run the test Octoprint server:

../OctoPrint/venv3/bin/octoprint serve --port 4000

There is also a test web server to simulate the Touchscreen web server running in Node and javascript.
It is stored in /Development/TemperatureWebServer.

> node server.js

It runs on port 8081 and sends out JSON for two temperatures and the VOC.
